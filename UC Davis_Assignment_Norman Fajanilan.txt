Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i.    Attribute table = 10,000
ii.   Business table = 10,000
iii.  Category table = 10,000
iv.   Checkin table = 10,000
v.    elite_years table = 10,000
vi.   friend table = 10,000
vii.  hours table = 10,000 
viii. photo table = 10,000 
ix.   review table = 10,000 
x.    tip table = 10,000 
xi.   user table = 10,000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i.    Business = 10,000 (id)
ii.   Hours = 1,562 (business_id)
iii.  Category = 2,643 (business_id)
iv.   Attribute = 1,115 (business_id)
v.    Review = 10,000(id), 8,090 (Using business_id), 9,581 (user_id)
vi.   Checkin = 493 (business_id)
vii.  Photo = 10,000 (id), 6,493 (business_id) 
viii. Tip = 3,979 (business_id), 537 (user_id) 
ix.   User = 10,000 (id)
x.    Friend = 11 (user_id) 
xi.   Elite_years = 2,780 (user_id) 

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
         Yes. The 4-5 star rating groups in general have shorter hours than the 2-3 star group.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         Yes. The 4-5 star group have more number of reviews than the 2-3 star group.
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
         No. All the business show different Postal Codes.

SQL code used for analysis:
         SELECT  city, category, postal_code, review_count, hours, 
         CASE
         WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3'
         WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5'
         END AS Rating_Stars
         FROM business AS b INNER JOIN hours AS h ON b.id = h.business_id
         INNER JOIN category AS c ON c.business_id = b.id
         WHERE (b.city = 'Toronto' AND c.category = 'Restaurants')
         AND (b.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 OR b.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
         ORDER by Rating_Stars  
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
        Average star rating for open shops is larger than the closed ones.
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
        The sum and average of review counts for open shops is significantly larger than the closed shops.
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
        SELECT is_open, COUNT(*), SUM(review_count), AVG(review_count), AVG(stars)
        FROM business
        GROUP BY is_open

+---------+----------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------+
| is_open | COUNT(*) | SUM(review_count) | AVG(review_count) |    AVG(stars) |
+---------+----------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------+
|       0 |     1520 |             35261 |     23.1980263158 | 3.52039473684 |
|       1 |     8480 |            269300 |     31.7570754717 | 3.67900943396 |
+---------+----------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------+

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
          It will be a supervised machine learning under binary classification predicting if the business 
          will stay open or close based on the selected features.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
          Many factors will be at play to help predict if the business will stay open or not. Columns in business table provides many important information
          such as specific locations, business star rating and number of reviews.

          Additional column from other tables will be combined such as the number of hours open, the category and attribute of the business. Review table also 
          provides crucial information with the review star rating and it would also be interesting to see the influence of columns useful, funny and cool. 

                  
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------+---------+-------+-------------+----------+-----------+---------------+--------------+--------------------+-----------+----------------------------+-------------+--------+-------+------+---------+
